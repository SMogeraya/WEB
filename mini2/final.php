<u><h1>Flute/Bhansuri</h1></u><br>
    <p>The flute is a beautiful and versatile instrument that can produce a range of sounds and styles. However, choosing the right flute for you can be a challenge, especially if you’re a beginner. There are many factors to consider, such as the material, the type, the budget, and the brand of the flute.    <strong>Tips for choosing the right Bansuri for you</strong><br>
    Several factors play a key role while making the perfect choice for a flute. They are as follows:
<br>
<strong>Holes in the Flute</strong><br>
To get the most out of your flute, you should choose bamboo or a PVC flute. If your bamboo flute has any cracks or sharp edges, be sure to check it out first! You should pick a PVC flute that is devoid of plasticizers if you want to buy one. Before purchasing a flute, you can ask the maker about this<strong>Consider the size</strong><br>
<strong>Holes in the Flute</strong><br>
Folies have round, well-made holes, which are essential to the entire process of playing. The number of holes in a transverse flute should be at least seven, whereas the number of holes in a fipple flute should be at least six. On top of that, your flute’s holes should be aligned in a straight line.<br>

<strong>Check the cork in the flute</strong><br>
Cork placement in flutes is critical. This will keep the flute’s air from escaping, resulting in a dry or airy tone. If you’re going to use a cork in your flute, be careful to position it appropriately inside of the instrument.

<strong>Consider the brand</strong><br>
Reputable violin brands are more likely to produce high-quality instruments. Do some research and consider well-known brands.

<br>
<strong>Tuned flute or not</strong><br>
Keep in mind when purchasing a bamboo flute that the instrument is tuned at the time of production. Flute makers should be consulted before purchasing a flute. This may be done by a skilled flutist.<br>
<strong>Straight flute or not</strong><br>
your flute should be perfectly straight so that the airwaves inside the pipe are produced appropriately. To verify if your line of sight is straight, a glance from one end of the bamboo flute is much appreciated. The result of playing the flute that is not straight is a horse and dry sound every time.    </p>
